# topoPhonon
topoPhonon package is a python package that allows users to calculate topological properties, by building phonon tight-binding model. 
#Calculate berry phase, berry curvature, wannier charge center evolution from tight-binding model.
#Build slab/ribbon models for surface/edge 
#plot 3d band surfaces.
